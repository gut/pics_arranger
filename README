Pics_arranger
============

These scripts were made so it's easier to sort a lot of pictures (probably from
different resources/cameras) in the same chronological order. My problem was
with undefined timezone so the script applies the difference of hours (if you
need to diminish this granularity, fell free to change the code, it's simple
enough)

Dependencies:
-------------

python v2.X and pyexiv2 library (ubuntu package name: python-pyexiv2)


How to use it:
--------------

To change the hours (or any other greater aspect, like day or month):
./chgPicTime.py
e.g: change the picture photo.jpg to increase 2 hours:
./chgPicTime.py 2 photo.jpg
e.g: change the picture photo.jpg to decrease 2 hours:
./chgPicTime.py -- -2 photo.jpg
    ps: the -- is needed or else the optparse lib will think that "-2" is a key
    argument.

To sort the pics:
./renomPicsByDate.py
To write down the changes you'll have to type --write or -w.
To view the timestamps that are being sorted, run it with --verbose or -v.
